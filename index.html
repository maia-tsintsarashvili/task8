    <p>  I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were 
        current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got
         every penny’s worth. </p>


<p class="text">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
     I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had 
     an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and 
     found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks
      was the  best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the
       course, I’ve  successfully switched careers, working as a Software 
       Engineer at a VR startup. ” </p>

    <p>  The team was very supportive and kept me motivated </p>

<p class="text">   “ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills.
     I now work as a mobile engineer for a big company.
     This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. “ </p>

    <p>  Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
         Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.
         </p>

<p class="text"> “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which 
    I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to 
    be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
     developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
      attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing 
      people.  ”  </p>

    <p class="text-1">  Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>


<p class="text-2">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!  ”  </p>
